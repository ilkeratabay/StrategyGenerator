Product Requirements Document (PRD)
1. Introduction
This document details the requirements for a comprehensive web application designed for financial strategy developers and algorithmic trading enthusiasts. The application aims to facilitate the conversion of Pine Script strategies created in TradingView to Python, and Python-developed strategies back to Pine Script suitable for TradingView. It will also offer advanced backtesting and optimization capabilities for Python-based strategies, and the ability to generate live trading signals for notification via Telegram. Users will be able to manage, test, and optimize their strategies, experiment across various cryptocurrency pairs, and monitor the performance of generated signals through a user-friendly, web-based interface.

2. Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to streamline strategy development and testing processes by providing seamless and error-free strategy conversion between Pine Script and Python. Additionally, it aims to empower users to develop profitable strategies suited to market conditions by offering robust backtesting and optimization tools. A key focus of this application will be the pursuit of strategies for low-timeframe (5-15 minute) cryptocurrency trading, including near real-time signal generation, Telegram notification, and performance tracking.

3. Features and Modules
3.1. Pine Script & Python Code Conversion Module
Pinescript to Python Conversion: The module will convert complex Pine Script strategies, including function definitions, and advanced features like var, varip, security(), and request.security(), into Python code. The target Python libraries will be TA (Technical Analysis library for Pandas) and backtrader for indicators, with custom development for any calculations not covered by these libraries. In cases where a direct equivalent is not found, a warning will be issued, and the conversion will proceed upon user confirmation.
Python to Pinescript Conversion: Python strategies containing complex financial calculations will be converted back into Pine Script, adhering to its syntax.
Strategy Storage: Both the Python code and associated parameters of created strategies will be stored in a database (or suitable storage mechanism).
3.2. Python Strategy Backtesting Module
Backtesting Engine: The backtrader library will serve as the primary engine for backtesting strategies.
Data Source: Financial data for backtesting will be fetched from Yahoo Finance (in OHLCV format with timestamps).
Performance Metrics: The main criteria will be Net Profit and Profit Factor. Additionally, generally accepted metrics such as Max Drawdown, Sharpe Ratio, Number of Trades, Win Rate, Average Win/Average Loss, and Risk/Reward Ratio will be provided.
Transaction Costs and Slippage: Commissions and slippage models will be incorporated into the backtesting process to achieve realistic results.
Risk Management Integration: Strategies will consider risk management rules such as Stop-Loss, Take-Profit, and position sizing during backtesting.
3.3. Parameter Optimization Module
Optimization Algorithm: Initially, the Random Search algorithm will be employed. The potential to transition to Bayesian Optimization will be kept open, depending on performance expectations and future needs.
Overfitting Prevention: Walk-Forward Optimization, Out-of-Sample Testing, and Parameter Robustness Checks will be implemented.
Performance Target: A single strategy backtest on one cryptocurrency pair using 1 year of 5-minute data is targeted to complete within 1-2 minutes, while optimization (with a reasonable number of iterations using Random Search) aims to complete within 5-10 minutes.
3.4. Live Signal Generation and Bot Integration Module
Near Real-Time Signal Generation: This will function as a separate module, continuously generating signals in the background for user-selected strategies and cryptocurrency lists. Data will be pulled from the Binance API every 5 minutes (or aggregated from lower timeframes to form 5-minute candles).
Signal Transmission: Generated buy/sell signals (e.g., "BTCUSDT LONG 52000 TP:52500 SL:51500") will be sent to a pre-existing Telegram bot via Python's Telegram API libraries (e.g., python-telegram-bot). Direct order placement to exchanges is outside the current scope.
Signal and Trade Performance Tracking: Every generated signal and simulated trade will be recorded in a database, specific to its strategy. Records will include Signal ID, Strategy ID/Name, Cryptocurrency, Signal Type, Price, Timestamp, Status (Open, Closed, Canceled), Close Price/Time, P&L, and Success Status (Profitable/Loss). Strategy-specific success rates will be calculated and tracked based on these records.
Telegram Bot Interaction: Users will be able to send specific commands to their bot to retrieve information:
/successrate [strategy_name] [crypto_pair]: Will return the signal success rate for the relevant strategy and/or cryptocurrency pair.
/status [strategy_name]: Will list all currently open signals for the specified strategy.
4. User Interface (UI) and Configuration
4.1. User Interface
Type: The application will feature a web-based interface.
Technology: The Streamlit library will be used for rapid development and to provide an interactive user experience.
Admin Panel / Strategy Management: A user-friendly panel will allow for easy updating of configuration settings and management of saved strategies (both code and parameters), including listing, selection, editing, and deletion.
4.2. Configuration Management
Format: All application configurations will be managed in YAML file format.
Content: The configuration file will contain all detailed parameters, including general application settings (log level, output directories), data settings (source (Yahoo Finance/Binance), tickers, timeframe, date ranges, API keys), Pine Script conversion settings, backtesting settings (initial capital, commission, slippage, warm-up period), dynamic strategy-specific parameters, optimization settings (including Walk-Forward), performance metric thresholds for analysis and filtering, and Telegram Bot settings.
Updates: The configuration file will be loaded upon each application startup, and changes made through the Admin Panel will be written back to the YAML file, triggering an update of the Streamlit application.
5. Test Automation and Quality Assurance
The project will strictly adhere to the principle: "development is not complete until testing is complete."

5.1. Test Levels
Unit Tests: Comprehensive unit tests will be written to ensure the correct functioning of every independent function and module.
Integration Tests: Integration tests will be developed to verify the correct interplay between different application modules and external systems (data APIs (Yahoo Finance, Binance), file system, database, Telegram API).
5.2. Test Tools
Test Framework: pytest will be the primary test framework for unit and integration tests.
UI Tests (Future Consideration): If required in the future, Selenium integration will be considered for end-to-end testing of the web interface.
5.3. Conversion Accuracy Tests
Methodology: The semantic accuracy of Pine Script to Python and Python to Pine Script conversions will be tested by comparing backtest results.
Test Flow: A set of reference Pine Script strategies of varying complexity will be created, and their manually verified backtest results (trade lists, prices, key performance metrics) from TradingView will be recorded as "ground truth." The application will convert these reference Pine Script codes to Python, and the converted Python code will be backtested using backtrader on the same dataset. The resulting backtest outcomes (trade lists and key metrics) will be compared against the reference Pine Script results within a defined tolerance range. This tolerance will account for minor discrepancies in financial calculations. This comparison logic will be automated using pytest.
